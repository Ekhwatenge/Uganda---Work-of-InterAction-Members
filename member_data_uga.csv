Women Building Livelihoods Through Farming ,"Association of Volunteers in International Service, USA",2021-08-19,,"Twenty-five farmers, including 19 women, came together to cultivate crops in
the ""Bitojjo-Tukorenamani"" (""Let's Work Hard"") Farmer Field Business School.
Before joining the school, their harvests barely had any financial impact on
their livelihood; they were mostly for home consumption. In 2018, AVSI's
Graduating to Resilience began supporting the school's members offering
service bundles that include seeds, training, and linkages to markets, and the
group's motivation grew. As part of the USAID-funded Activity, the farmers
also learned good practices such as pest management, proper crop spacing, and
soil and water conservation, alongside soil fertility management. [More

School Improvements in the Time of COVID-19,Catholic Relief Services,2020-10-07,,"In the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement in Uganda, schools are currently closed
due to COVID-19, but that doesn't mean that improvement has been halted. The
Karuhinda Primary School opened there in February of this year. Catholic
Relief Services has been working on expanding the number of classrooms up to
18, which will reduce classroom congestion, allowing for better physical
distancing and a more manageable number of pupils for each teacher. Education
is crucial for the refugee population, and with school improvements like the
ones taking place at Karuhinda Primary School, students there will be able to
thrive and reach their full potential.

"After 10 years, South Sudan Working to Resolve Crisis",Oxfam America,2021-07-30,,"Amid threats of pandemic, severe hunger, fighting, and floods, Oxfam and
partners continue to assist South Sudanese. Oxfam and FEMRITE supported South
Sudanese women artists to publish a poetry compendium this year, called No
Time to Mourn. A handful of authors read their work at the launch event in
Juba, South Sudan, in early July, and voiced their concerns about the ways
conflict has affected them and their country.

Oxfam is providing clean water and sanitation supplies and promoting public
health in South Sudan, distributing food or providing cash to help families
meet their food needs. As of mid-July 2021, Oxfam is reaching more than
398,000 people.

Oxfam is working closely with eight South Sudanese organizations that are
helping families produce their own food, supporting education, and advocating
for the rights of citizens with a focus on women and girls. [More

Working with youth and local partners to improve livelihoods,GOAL Global,2021-12-08,,"In one community in Uganda, GOAL and the Mastercard Foundation have partnered
with local private and public sectors to support community members to access
affordable financial services, participate in trainings in agricultural
systems and business skills, and access new job opportunities as part of the
Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery Program (CRRP).

One community member, Nancy, received training as an agro-input supplier in
partnership with a local private sector company. After her initial success, a
local bank and partner in the program further provided Nancy with the
affordable loan she needed to be more mobile and increase both her customer
base and her seasonal income eight-fold. She has since used both what she
learned in the program and her increased income to diversify her family's
income base through the construction and management of a catfish farm along
with her siblings. [More
